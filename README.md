# Hardest
1. Subarray sum equals k
2. Subarray product equals K
3. Continuous subarray sum
4. Longest increasing subsequence
5. Longest common subsequence

# Ideas
- Quickselect Hoare's selection algorithm
- Union find
- Next permutation algorithm
- Transpose a matrix: Transposition is an operation that flips the matrix over its diagonal
- Rotate image   
  - Transpose and Reflect!
- Convert 2D matrix in 1D array
  - There is a formula for converting 2D matrices into 1D arrays and vice versa
    -- n * m matrix convert to an array => `matrix[x][y] => a[x * m + y]`
    -- an array convert to n * m matrix => `a[x] =>matrix[x / m][x % m];`
