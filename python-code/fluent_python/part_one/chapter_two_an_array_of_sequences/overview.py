"""
The standard library contains a rich selection of sequences typed ion C:
1. Container sequences: They can contain objects of different types and, they contain
references to these objects
e.g. list, tuple, deque
2. Flat sequences: They only contain object of a specific type and, they hold the
values of the objects in their own memory space!
e.g. str, bytes, array
